### K-Means for Image Compression
This is a Python implementation of K-means algorithm for image compression. Given an input image and initial clusters, the algorithm compresses the image.

### Dependencies
The code depends on the following Python packages:

* NumPy
* Matplotlib

### Usage Example
Here is an example command to run the algorithm on an input image with 3 clusters:

```sh
python3 ex1.py dog.jpeg cents3.txt output.txt
```

The compressed image will be saved in the `compressed_dog.jpeg` file, the centroids for each iteration until 
convergence in `output.txt`.
